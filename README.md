# OrbitSimulation
This is an orbit simulation of a rocket/satellite launched from the Earth that performs Homann transfer and orbits around the Moon. With in the project, various mathematical technique were used. Euler's method, for example, was used to update the parameters of the rocket and the Moon. Vectors and trigonometry also played an important role in this project.
